                        <span class="read-more-text">Whole day got wasted... after schooli went to bed.. thought ok will wake up and study and kudos there was a cake cutting... well i am still ashamed of me. How the fk i can forget her birthday like how.. i worked my whole night and thought maybe today i can get myself in a better position but.. in the very first period i again got scolding well scolding is not the problem if it were just that.. rather he was humbling me.. ahh ok he is my teacher, but why daily . Like can't there could be a single day when i can be pass 5 periods in peace.. and then sitting in the class i remembered her birthday like.. yes i didn't forget just due to all recent mind fking things i got off my head but yet she is my mother and i should be ashamed of this. <br> 
i thought that i'll study after cake cutting but it's 1:28 am and not a single word on the page... ya since last blog i did completed some of my task so not that bad day but .. these daily scoldings and the way all teacher putting me down.. i am god damm suffering.. ok i got an strategy to study its like gorilla warfare.. whenever i get time i'll on my books.. and also to invest time wisely.. now i am at the position where i need to be a wise man.. well i believe that i was just overthinking but ya it was worth it.. sometimes you need to humble you yourself to keep your legs on ground or i say in puddle.  Well there are some philosophies goinn round my head.. i will tell that latter.. and ya tomorrow in school i will redesign this shit.. so a new look is coming soon..

                            just goes in adjusting the position of the box.
                            Well, again it's Rakshabandhan, and just this year
                            will also be boring.. as sis is not here.. well,
                            also this is the last day of the 5-day vacation, so
                            this night I have to complete calculus by hook or by
                            crook... <br />
                            If I speak about development, then I added a read
                            more button today and also made a template, so each
                            day I have to just paste the template and start
                            writing.. and tomorrow I'll try to style it, and
                            this website will be completed. <br />
