             There is one thing that will never change.. and honestly idk what should be my reaction. whenever i have a deadline my creative mind activates it self.. and gives out the best idea.. just the problem is time.. always on wrong timing.. <br> well update for this site <br>● Remaped the UI <br />● linked the site to github <br> <br> At the end.. i got some awesom ideas for other projects but honestly i have to control my temptation this time and just focus on studies.. and i guess i'll learn to live in less sleep in few days.. so yup.. i see this as progress but yip quite slow.. anyways <br>BUENOS NOCHES</span>

                    <p>
                        <span class="read-more-text">Whole day got wasted... after schooli went to bed.. thought ok will wake up and study and kudos there was a cake cutting... well i am still ashamed of me. How the fk i can forget her birthday like how.. i worked my whole night and thought maybe today i can get myself in a better position but.. in the very first period i again got scolding well scolding is not the problem if it were just that.. rather he was humbling me.. ahh ok he is my teacher, but why daily . Like can't there could be a single day when i can be pass 5 periods in peace.. and then sitting in the class i remembered her birthday like.. yes i didn't forget just due to all recent mind fking things i got off my head but yet she is my mother and i should be ashamed of this. <br> 
i thought that i'll study after cake cutting but it's 1:28 am and not a single word on the page... ya since last blog i did completed some of my task so not that bad day but .. these daily scoldings and the way all teacher putting me down.. i am god damm suffering.. ok i got an strategy to study its like gorilla warfare.. whenever i get time i'll on my books.. and also to invest time wisely.. now i am at the position where i need to be a wise man.. well i believe that i was just overthinking but ya it was worth it.. sometimes you need to humble you yourself to keep your legs on ground or i say in puddle.  Well there are some philosophies goinn round my head.. i will tell that latter.. and ya tomorrow in school i will redesign this shit.. so a new look is coming soon..

                            Ok, so here we are again.. but this time added a

                            if I speak about designing, I will keep that for
                            another day.. exams are near so I have to manage my

                            fun.. wasted my time a lot.. yes I can't

                            TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITIES. Well, tomorrow I have a
                            test, and honestly, I won't be studying for it as it
                            is not worth it.. a test where one could easily
                            score by cheating.. I can study, but if I manage
                            time, I can do more productive tasks... well, I need
                            to make myself better; I am getting good but not
                            enough.. well, it's time to say good night... <br />

                            You know what.. It's not fun to do web development..
                            just because of designing, like 40% of your time
                            just goes in adjusting the position of the box.
                            Well, again it's Rakshabandhan, and just this year
                            will also be boring.. as sis is not here.. well,
                            also this is the last day of the 5-day vacation, so
                            this night I have to complete calculus by hook or by
                            crook... <br />
                            If I speak about development, then I added a read
                            more button today and also made a template, so each
                            day I have to just paste the template and start
                            writing.. and tomorrow I'll try to style it, and
                            this website will be completed. <br />

                            should study now as it's 3 am, but dumb of me
                            writing a website that will hardly have 2 visitors
                            monthly.. maybe 30 as I have to see that each day,
                            but yeah.. I am dumb.. there are exams on Tuesday,
                            and.. I am wasting time writing junk.. well, yet

                            later.. well, I am feeling tired after writing such
                            junk code.. so good night world. Tomorrow I will try
                            to update this junk UI, and I am a noob, so yes,
                            it's all hard-coded, so enjoy hurting your eyes
